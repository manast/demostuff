  Introduction:

  If you have coded programs for dos 32 (by Adam Seychell), you probably
  have found some problems with the memory allocation functions. They are
  very limited. Only allow 64 allocations and you must free the blocks in
  a stack order. So everyone who wants to code any serious program for
  dos 32 will need to code new memory funtions. I did so. I just coded
  this tiny memory unit. Very easy to use and it will fit in everybody
  needs.

  Btw, this software is of coz freeware (what else?!). So use it as much
  as you want (that will make me happy).


  How to use it:

  There are just two functions, Allocmem and Freemem.

  - Allocmem
        In: edx -> amount of memory to alloc in bytes
        Out: Carry clear and edx with pointer to memory block
             Carry set if error (not enough memory)

  - Freemem
        In: edx -> pointer to block
        Error: carry set (edx wasnt a memory block)


   Well, as easy as that. Then just link your program with memory.obj
   (with dlink of coz)
