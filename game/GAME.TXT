Game Ideas
~~~~~~~~~~

- Game Purpose:
  The objetive of the game is to pick all the desired objects of the screen.
  The Character is a guy who cant stop jumping, and each time he jumps the
  ground disapear, so the more time you use to pick the objects, the more 
  dificult because there is less and less ground.
  Simple he? 

- Enemies.
  There will be a lot of enemies, flying enemies, non flying enemies, etc,etc

- Objects.
  In each screen you have to take a number of objects, f.e. , it could be
  coconuts, and you have to pick all the coconuts of the screen to pass.
  There will be other objects, like lifes, speed up, jump up, etc,etc.

- Tech info.
  The idea is a plattform-arcade game. it has to be very fast and very 
  adictive, is there where we have to work hard.
  I have planned to make the game in 320x240c256, i think is a nice resolution,
  and we can have hardware scrolly. I have already coded a lot of the sprite
  engine, but i have to recode all the stuff to pmode, because i think that
  the game should be coded in EOS (eclipse extenter), which is very nice, and 
  it includes SB/GUS MOD rutines, KEYBOARD stuff, etc ,etc that will be very 
  usefull for us.

- A example of a game screen.
  We could have a 320x600 background and then scroll up and down there.
  First i though it would be nice some score window or something, but at the
  end I decided to show the score info directly over the background, without 
  windows, so you will have a bigger play window.

And i think thats all.
