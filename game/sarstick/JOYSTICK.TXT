                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Quick explanation:

 This is just a unit that handle the joystick stuff in a fancy way.
 You dont need to center anything or something like that. Just use the
 procedures provided and you dont have to worth about anything else.

 The limitation is that you wont get the simulator joystick features, and
 it is because this unit is just for using in arcade games or other games
 where doesnt matter how fast you move the stick, it always responds the 
 same speed.

 I coded this just for my needs. But i thought that maybe someone could find
 it usefull too, so here it is. I give it as Freeware. So use it as you want
 but remeber to give me some greets/credits.


 The interface is quite simple. Just three procedures:

 - CheckJoystick
        In: Nothing
        Out: CL with info about joysticks detected.
             Bit 0 - Joy A detected 
             Bit 1 - Joy B detected
             1 means detected

 - CheckButtons
        In: AL - 1 = joy A. 2 = joy B
            AH - 1 = button A, 2 = button B, 3= button C, etc
        Out: Carry set if button pressed

 - CheckStick
        In: Nothing
        Out: CL
               Joy B | Joy A
        CL = |7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|
              U D L R|U D L R

        U = UP, D = Down, L = Left, R = Right        
        Bits = 1 means pressed
