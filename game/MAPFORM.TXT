     29           1                   Tile Y Length

- Palette:
   offset     length (Bytes)
     30         768 

- Tile Array:

   Begins at offset 798 and is "Tile Array length" double words.
   Its a double word array of offsets. Every position in the array is the
   tile number, and the offset is where in the GFX Block is that tile GFX.

- Tile atributes:
    
   Its a table of "Tile Array length" bytes.
   Every byte represents the attribute of each tile.
   Sar edit uses this table:
        0 = Background
        1 = Solid
        2 = Magic  (this can be used for secrets objects etc)
        . = Magic
        . = Magic
        . = Magic
        etc

- Gfx Data:
   
   Its the Graphics block. If it is compressed you have to decompress it
   before you can use it.

- Tile Data:
   
   Its the MAP itself. At every position of each tile you a word (0-65535)
   representing the tile number. You can get the Tile gfx just looking at
   the Tile array table, and use that offset to copy from the GFX data.
