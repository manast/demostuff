                       Sarwaz Sprites Engine (tm) v1.0

1 - Introduction.

This stuff you have now in your hands is a complete Sprite engine (Fast) which
works under both plain mode 13h and some mode-x.
I coded this system for my own use, but i thought that it was cool to release
this stuff to help everyone coding a videogame.
First of all i have to tell you that this software is Freeware. So you can use
it as long as you wish in the manner you want but always with the code unchan-
ged and for use in non-comercial stuff. Of course i accept registrations, 
if you register you will get the full sources, the version 2.0 for Protected 
mode and the licence for using this software in comercial stuff. 
Fill the registration form SPRITES.FRM and send it to me. You can try via 
e-mail (recomended) or snail-mail. The adresses are at the end of the doc. 

About this stuff i have to tell you that im quite happy with it. Right now it 
support the following features:

þ From 0 to 255 sprites simultaneous on the screen.
þ 256x256 Max. Sprite size.
þ Totally Transparent sprite managing for the user.
þ Sprite colision detection.
þ Full interactivity with SBE (Sarwaz Bobs Engine)
