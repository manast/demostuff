Scrolltext on the bottom.

Menu font size. Same font size but different style?

Buttons on the right:

* Next Tune

About the menu:

When you select a tune info will appear in the same blue box
where the menu is. Once you press ESC you will get back to
the menu.

Should the blue box be scrollable incase we write more
than one page of text for each tune (and other info)?

You don't have to do mouse-support! :)

If you're in the main menu, pressing ESC will quit the musicdisk.

Something more?
